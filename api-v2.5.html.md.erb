## <a id='changelog'></a>Document Changelog ##

[v2 API Change Log](v2-api-changelog.html)

<%= partial "version_table.html" %>

## <a id='changes'></a>Changes ##

### <a id='change-policy'></a>Change Policy ###

* Existing endpoints and fields will not be removed or renamed.
* New optional endpoints, or new HTTP methods for existing endpoints, may be
added to enable support for new features.
* New fields may be added to existing request/response messages.
These fields must be optional and should be ignored by clients and servers
that do not understand them.

### <a id='api-changes-since-v2-4'></a>Changes Since v2.4 ###

1. Added support for users to send service-specific configuration parameters along with provision, update and bind requests.
1. The `service_id` field is now included with update service instance requests.
1. The `app_guid` is no longer guaranteed to be included with create service binding requests.

## <a id='dependencies'></a>Dependencies ##

v2.5 of the services API has been supported since:

* [Final build 211](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/tree/v211) of [cf-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/)
* v2.27.0 of the Cloud Controller API

## <a id='api-overview'></a>API Overview ##

The Cloud Foundry services API defines the contract between the Cloud
Controller and the service broker.
The broker is expected to implement several HTTP (or HTTPS) endpoints
underneath a URI prefix.
One or more services can be provided by a single broker, and load balancing
enables horizontal scalability of redundant brokers.
Multiple Cloud Foundry instances can be supported by a single broker using
different URL prefixes and credentials.

## <a id='api-version-header'></a>API Version Header ##

Requests from the Cloud Controller to the broker contain a header that defines
the version number of the Broker API that Cloud Controller will use.
This header will be useful in future minor revisions of the API to allow
brokers to reject requests from Cloud Controllers that they do not understand.
While minor API revisions will always be additive, it is possible that brokers
will come to depend on a feature that was added after 2.0, so they may use this
header to reject the request.
Error messages from the broker in this situation should inform the operator of
what the required and actual version numbers are so that an operator can go
upgrade Cloud Controller and resolve the issue.
A broker should respond with a `412 Precondition Failed` message when rejecting
a request.

The version numbers are in the format `MAJOR.MINOR`, using semantic versioning
such that 2.9 comes before 2.10.
An example of this header as of publication time is:

`X-Broker-Api-Version: 2.5`

## <a id='authentication'></a>Authentication ##

Cloud Controller (final release v145+) authenticates with the Broker using HTTP
basic authentication (the `Authorization:` header) on every request and will
reject any broker registrations that do not contain a username and password.
The broker is responsible for checking the username and password and returning
a `401 Unauthorized` message if credentials are invalid.
Cloud Controller supports connecting to a broker using SSL if additional
security is desired.

## <a id='catalog-mgmt'></a>Catalog Management ##

The first endpoint that a broker must implement is the service catalog.
Cloud Controller will initially fetch this endpoint from all brokers and make
adjustments to the user-facing service catalog stored in the Cloud Controller
database.
If the catalog fails to initially load or validate, Cloud Controller will not
allow the operator to add the new broker and will give a meaningful error
message.
Cloud Controller will also update the catalog whenever a broker is updated, so
you can use `update-service-broker` with no changes to force a catalog refresh.

When Cloud Controller fetches a catalog from a broker, it will compare the
broker's id for services and plans with the `unique_id` values for services and
plan in the  Cloud Controller database.
If a service or plan in the broker catalog has an id that is not present
amongst the `unique_id` values in the database, a new record will be added to
the database.
If services or plans in the database are found with `unique_id`s that match the
broker catalog's id, Cloud Controller will update update the records to match
the broker’s catalog.

If the database has plans which are not found in the broker catalog, and there
are no associated service instances, Cloud Controller will remove these plans
from the database. Cloud Controller will then delete services that do not have associated plans
from the database.
If the database has plans which are not found in the broker catalog, and there
**are** provisioned instances, the plan will be marked “inactive” and will
no longer be visible in the marketplace catalog or be provisionable.

### <a id='create-broker'></a>Adding a Broker to Cloud Foundry ###

Once you've implemented the first endpoint `GET /v2/catalog` above, you'll want
to [register the broker with CF](managing-service-brokers.html#register-broker)
to make your services and plans available to end users.

## <a id='provisioning'></a>Provisioning ##

When the broker receives a provision request from Cloud Controller, it should
synchronously take whatever action is necessary to create a new service
resource for the developer.
The result of provisioning varies by service type, although there are a few
common actions that work for many services.
For a MySQL service, provisioning could result in:

* An empty dedicated `mysqld` process running on its own VM.
* An empty dedicated `mysqld` process running in a lightweight container on a
shared VM.
* An empty dedicated `mysqld` process running on a shared VM.
* An empty dedicated database, on an existing shared running `mysqld`.
* A database with business schema already there.
* A copy of a full database, for example a QA database that is a copy of the
production database.

For non-data services, provisioning could just mean getting an account on an
existing system.

## <a id='updating_service_instance'></a>Updating a Service Instance ##

Brokers that implement this endpoint can enable users to modify attributes of an existing service instance. The first attribute Cloud Foundry supports users modifying is the service plan. This effectively enables users to upgrade or downgrade their service instance to other plans. To see how users make these requests, see [Managing Services](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#update_service).

To enable this functionality, a broker declares support for each service by including `plan_updateable: true` in its [catalog endpoint](#catalog-mgmt). If this optional field is not included, Cloud Foundry will return a meaningful error to users for any plan change request, and will not make an API call to the broker. If this field is included and configured as true, Cloud Foundry will make API calls to the broker for all plan change requests, and it is up to the broker to validate whether a particular permutation of plan change is supported. Not all permutations of plan changes are expected to be supported. For example, a service may support upgrading from plan "shared small" to "shared large" but not to plan "dedicated". If a particular plan change is not supported, the broker should return a meaningful error message in response.

All response bodies must be a valid JSON Object (`{}`). This is for future compatibility; it will be easier to add fields in the future if JSON is expected rather than to support the cases when a JSON body may or may not be returned.

For a success response, the expected response body is `{}`.

## <a id='binding'></a>Binding ##

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Not all services must be bindable --- some deliver value just from being provisioned. Brokers that offer services that are not bindable should declare them as such using `bindable: false` in the [Catalog](#catalog-mgmt). Brokers that do not offer any bindable services do not need to implement the endpoint for bind requests.</p>

When the broker receives a bind request from the Cloud Controller, it should return information which helps an application to utilize the provisioned resource. This information is generically referred to as `credentials`. Applications should be issued unique credentials whenever possible, so one application's access can be revoked without affecting other bound applications. For more information on credentials, see [Binding Credentials](binding-credentials.html).

In addition, the bind operation can enable streaming of application logs from Cloud Foundry to a consuming service instance. For details, see [Application Log Streaming](app-log-streaming.html).

## <a id='unbinding'></a>Unbinding ##

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Brokers that do not provide any bindable services do not need to implement the endpoint for unbind requests.</p>

When a broker receives an unbind request from Cloud Controller, it should
delete any resources it created in bind.
Usually this means that an application immediately cannot access the resource.

### Request ###

##### Route #####
`DELETE /v2/service_instances/:instance_id/service_bindings/:binding_id`

The `:binding_id` in the URL is the identifier of a previously created binding (the same `:binding_id` passed in the bind request). The request has no body, because DELETE requests generally do not have bodies.

##### Parameters #####

The request provides these query string parameters as useful hints for brokers.

  <td>Should be returned if the binding does not exist. The expected response body is `{}`</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Responses with any other status code will be interpreted as a failure and the binding will remain in the Cloud Controller database. Brokers can include a user-facing message in the `description` field; for details see [Broker Errors](#broker-errors).

##### Body #####

All response bodies must be a valid JSON Object (`{}`). This is for future compatibility; it will be easier to add fields in the future if JSON is expected rather than to support the cases when a JSON body may or may not be returned.

For a success response, the expected response body is `{}`.

## <a id='deprovisioning'></a>Deprovisioning ##

When a broker receives a deprovision request from Cloud Controller, it should
delete any resources it created during the provision.
Usually this means that all resources are immediately reclaimed for future
provisions.

### Request ###

##### Route #####
`DELETE /v2/service_instances/:instance_id`

The `:instance_id` in the URL is the identifier of a previously provisioned instance (the same
`:instance_id` passed in the provision request).  The request has no body, because DELETE
requests generally do not have bodies.

##### Parameters #####

The request provides these query string parameters as useful hints for brokers.

<table border="1" class="nice">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Query-String Field</th>
  <th>Type</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>service_id*</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>ID of the service from the catalog. While not strictly necessary, some brokers might make use of this ID. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>plan_id*</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>ID of the plan from the catalog. While not strictly necessary, some brokers might make use of this ID.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl 'http://username:password@broker-url/v2/service_instances/:instance_id?service_id=
    service-id-here&plan_id=plan-id-here' -X DELETE -H "X-Broker-API-Version: 2.5"

Responses with any other status code will be interpreted as a failure and the service instance will remain in the Cloud Controller database. Brokers can include a user-facing message in the `description` field; for details see [Broker Errors](#broker-errors).

##### Body #####

All response bodies must be a valid JSON Object (`{}`). This is for future compatibility; it will be easier to add fields in the future if JSON is expected rather than to support the cases when a JSON body may or may not be returned.

For a success response, the expected response body is `{}`.

## <a id='broker-errors'></a>Broker Errors ##

### Response ###

Broker failures beyond the scope of the well-defined HTTP response codes listed
above (like 410 on delete) should return an appropriate HTTP response code
(chosen to accurately reflect the nature of the failure) and a body containing a valid JSON Object (not an array).

##### Body #####

All response bodies must be a valid JSON Object (`{}`). This is for future compatibility; it will be easier to add fields in the future if JSON is expected rather than to support the cases when a JSON body may or may not be returned.

For error responses, the following fields are valid. Others will be ignored. If an empty JSON object is returned in the body `{}`, a generic message containing the HTTP response code returned by the broker will be displayed to the requestor.

<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Response Field</th>
  <th>Type</th>
  <th>Description</th>

<tr>
  <td>description</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>An error message explaining why the request failed. This message will be displayed to the user who initiated the request.

## <a id='orphans'></a>Orphans ##

The Cloud Controller is the source of truth for service instances and bindings. Service brokers are expected to have successfully provisioned all the instances and bindings Cloud Controller knows about, and none that it doesn't.

Orphans can result if the broker does not return a response before a request from Cloud Controller times out (typically 60 seconds). For example, if a broker does not return a response to a provision request before Cloud Controller times out, the broker might eventually succeed in provisioning an instance after Cloud Controller considers the request a failure. This results in an orphan instance on the service side.

To mitigate orphan instances and bindings, Cloud Controller will attempt to delete resources it cannot be sure were successfully created, and will keep trying to delete them until the broker responds with a success.

More specifically, when a provision or bind request to the broker fails, Cloud Controller will immediately send a corresponding delete or unbind request. If the delete or unbind request fails, Cloud Controller will retry the delete or unbind request ten times with an exponental backoff schedule (over a period of 34 hours).

<table border="1" class="nice">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Status code</th>
  <th>Result</th>
  <th>Orphan mitigation</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>200</td>
  <td>Success</td>
  <td></td>

<tr>
  <td>200 with malformed response</td>
  <td>Failure</td>
  <td></td>

  <td>201</td>
  <td>Success</td>

  <td>201 with malformed response</td>
  <td>Failure</td>

  <td>All other 2xx</td>
  <td>Failure</td>
  <td>Yes</td>

  <td>408</td>
  <td>Failure due to timeout</td>

  <td>5xx</td>
  <td>Broker error</td>
  <td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Timeout</td>
  <td>Failure</td>
  <td>Yes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If the Cloud Controller encounters an internal error provisioning an instance or binding (for example, saving to the database fails), then the Cloud Controller will send a single delete or unbind request to the broker but will not retry.

This orphan mitigation behavior was introduced in cf-release v196.
