[v2 API Change Log](v2-api-changelog.html)

<%= partial "version_table.html" %>

## <a id='changes'></a>Changes ##

### <a id='change-policy'></a>Change Policy ###

* Existing endpoints and fields will not be removed or renamed.
* New optional endpoints, or new HTTP methods for existing endpoints, may be
added to enable support for new features.
* New fields may be added to existing request/response messages.
These fields must be optional and should be ignored by clients and servers
that do not understand them.

### <a id='api-changes-since-v2-3'></a>Changes Since v2.3 ###

The key change from v2.3 to v2.5 is support for users to change the service plan for a specified service instance.

## <a id='dependencies'></a>Dependencies ##

v2.5 of the services API has been supported since:

* [Final build 192](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/tree/v192) of [cf-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/commit/2b0309bde9880f7acb039ec9676f992254ce62d9)
* v2.17 of the [Cloud Controller API](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/commit/f8b31ecce5c2740d60818ac6cc8a9299120e3216)
* v6.7 of the Cloud Foundry [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli)

## <a id='api-overview'></a>API Overview ##

The Cloud Foundry services API defines the contract between the Cloud
Controller and the service broker.
The broker is expected to implement several HTTP (or HTTPS) endpoints
underneath a URI prefix.
One or more services can be provided by a single broker, and load balancing
enables horizontal scalability of redundant brokers.
Multiple Cloud Foundry instances can be supported by a single broker using
different URL prefixes and credentials.

## <a id='api-version-header'></a>API Version Header ##

Requests from the Cloud Controller to the broker contain a header that defines
the version number of the Broker API that Cloud Controller will use.
This header will be useful in future minor revisions of the API to allow
brokers to reject requests from Cloud Controllers that they do not understand.
While minor API revisions will always be additive, it is possible that brokers
will come to depend on a feature that was added after 2.0, so they may use this
header to reject the request.
Error messages from the broker in this situation should inform the operator of
what the required and actual version numbers are so that an operator can go
upgrade Cloud Controller and resolve the issue.
A broker should respond with a `412 Precondition Failed` message when rejecting
a request.

The version numbers are in the format `MAJOR.MINOR`, using semantic versioning
such that 2.9 comes before 2.10.
An example of this header as of publication time is:

`X-Broker-Api-Version: 2.5`

## <a id='authentication'></a>Authentication ##

Cloud Controller (final release v145+) authenticates with the Broker using HTTP
basic authentication (the `Authentication:` header) on every request and will
reject any broker registrations that do not contain a username and password.
The broker is responsible for checking the username and password and returning
a `401 Unauthorized` message if credentials are invalid.
Cloud Controller supports connecting to a broker using SSL if additional
security is desired.

## <a id='catalog-mgmt'></a>Catalog Management ##

The first endpoint that a broker must implement is the service catalog.
Cloud Controller will initially fetch this endpoint from all brokers and make
adjustments to the user-facing service catalog stored in the Cloud Controller
database.
If the catalog fails to initially load or validate, Cloud Controller will not
allow the operator to add the new broker and will give a meaningful error
message.
Cloud Controller will also update the catalog whenever a broker is updated, so
you can use `update-service-broker` with no changes to force a catalog refresh.

When Cloud Controller fetches a catalog from a broker, it will compare the
broker's id for services and plans with the `unique_id` values for services and
plan in the  Cloud Controller database.
If a service or plan in the broker catalog has an id that is not present
amongst the `unique_id` values in the database, a new record will be added to
the database.
If services or plans in the database are found with `unique_id`s that match the
broker catalog's id, Cloud Controller will update update the records to match
the broker’s catalog.

If the database has plans which are not found in the broker catalog, and there
are no associated service instances, Cloud Controller will remove these plans
from the database. Cloud Controller will then delete services that do not have associated plans
from the database.
If the database has plans which are not found in the broker catalog, and there
**are** provisioned instances, the plan will be marked “inactive” and will
no longer be visible in the marketplace catalog or be provisionable.

### <a id='create-broker'></a>Adding a Broker to Cloud Foundry ###

Once you've implemented the first endpoint `GET /v2/catalog` above, you'll want
to [register the broker with CF](managing-service-brokers.html#register-broker)
to make your services and plans available to end users.

## <a id='provisioning'></a>Provisioning ##

### The definition of provision differs by service ###

The result of provisioning varies by service type, although there are a few
common actions that work for many services.
For a MySQL service, provisioning could result in:

* An empty dedicated `mysqld` process running on its own VM.
* An empty dedicated `mysqld` process running in a lightweight container on a
shared VM.
* An empty dedicated `mysqld` process running on a shared VM.
* An empty dedicated database, on an existing shared running `mysqld`.
* A database with business schema already there.
* A copy of a full database, for example a QA database that is a copy of the
production database.

For non-data services, provisioning could just mean getting an account on an
existing system.

### Request ###

##### Route #####
`PUT /v2/service_instances/:instance_id`

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>:instance_id</code> of a service instance is provided by the Cloud Controller. This ID will be used for future requests (bind and deprovision), so the broker must use it to correlate the resource it creates.</p>

<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Query-String Field</th>
  <th>Type</th>
  <th>Description</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>accepts_incomplete</td>
  <td>boolean</td>
  <td>A value of true indicates that both the Cloud Controller and the requesting client support asynchronous provisioning. If this parameter is not included in the request, and the broker can only provision an instance of the requested plan asynchronously, the broker should reject the request with a 422 as described below.</td>

<tr>
  <td>service_id*</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>The ID of the service within the catalog above. While not strictly necessary, some brokers might make use of this ID.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>plan_id*</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>The ID of the plan within the above service (from the catalog endpoint) that the user would like provisioned. Because plans have identifiers unique to a broker, this is enough information to determine what to provision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>organization_guid*</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>The Cloud Controller GUID of the organization under which the service is to be provisioned. Although most brokers will not use this field, it could be helpful in determining data placement or applying custom business rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>space_guid*</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>Similar to organization_guid, but for the space.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<pre class="terminal">
{
  "service_id":        "service-guid-here",
  "plan_id":           "plan-guid-here",
  "organization_guid": "org-guid-here",
  "space_guid":        "space-guid-here"
}
</pre>

##### cURL #####
<pre class="terminal">

<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Status Code</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>201 Created</td>
  <td>Service instance has been created and is usable. The appropriate response for synchronous provisioning. The expected response body is described below.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>202 Accepted</td>
  <td>Service instance creation is in progress. The expected response body is described below but must include: <code>{ "last_operation": { "state": "in progress" } }</code>. This triggers Cloud Controller to poll the <a href="#service_instance">Service Instance Endpoint</a> for operation status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>200 OK</td>
  <td>May be returned if the service instance already exists and the requested parameters are identical to the existing service instance. The expected response body is the same as for <code>200</code> and will update the Cloud Controller database.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>409 Conflict</td>
  <td>Should be returned if the requested service instance already exists. The expected response body is <code>{}</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>422 Unprocessable Entity</td>
  <td>Should be returned if the broker only supports asynchronous provisioning for the requested plan and the request did not include <code>?accepts_incomplete=true</code>. The expected response body is: <code>{ "error": "AsyncRequired", "description": "This service plan requires support for asynchronous provisioning by Cloud Foundry and its clients." }</code>, as described below.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Responses with any other status code will be interpreted as a failure. Brokers can include a user-facing message in the `description` field; for details see [Broker Errors](#broker-errors).

##### Synchronous Provisioning #####

Brokers that can guarantee provisioning of a usable instance in less than a minute should return the synchronous response `201 CREATED`. If not, brokers should implement support for asynchronous provisioning. Regardless, brokers should respond to all Cloud Controller requests within 60 seconds.

##### Asynchronous Provisioning #####

If the broker supports asynchronous provisioning for the requested plan, and `?accepts_incomplete:true` was included in the request, it should return the asynchronous response `202 ACCEPTED`. The body must include:

<pre class="terminal">
{
  "last_operation": {
    "state": "in progress"
  }
}
</pre>

Additional optional fields are described below.

Brokers that only support asynchronous provisioning for the requested plan should reject requests that do not include `?accepts_incomplete:true` with a response of `422 UNPROCESSIBLE ENTITY` and body:

<pre class="terminal">
{
  "error": "AsyncRequired",
  "description": "This service plan requires support for asynchronous provisioning by Cloud Foundry and its clients."
}
</pre>

Brokers that support async must also implement the <a href="#service_instance">Service Instance Endpoint</a> that enables Cloud Controller to expose the status of the provision operation to users.

##### Body #####

All response bodies must be a valid JSON Object (`{}`). This is for future compatibility; it will be easier to add fields in the future if JSON is expected rather than to support the cases when a JSON body may or may not be returned.

Should be accompanied by <code>"description": This service plan requires support for asynchronous provisioning by Cloud Foundry and its clients.</code>. See <a href="#broker-errors">Broker Errors</a>) for more about the <code>description</code> field. The error code allows newer Cloud Controllers to return a meaningful default message; older Cloud Controllers will pass through the suggested value of the description field.</td>

## <a id='service_instance'></a>Get Service Instance Details ##

This endpoint is used by the Cloud Controller when the broker returns a `202 ACCEPTED` and `"state": "in progress"` in response to a <a href="#provisioning">provision</a> request. The Cloud
Controller will poll this endpoint as long as the broker returns `"state": "in progress"`. Returning `"state": "succeeded"` or `"state": "failed"` will cause Cloud Controller to cease polling.

## <a id='updating_service_instance'></a>Updating a Service Instance ##

Brokers that implement this endpoint can enable users to modify attributes of an existing service instance. The first attribute Cloud Foundry supports users modifying is the service plan. This effectively enables users to upgrade or downgrade their service instance to other plans. To see how users make these requests, see [Managing Services](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#update_service).

To enable this functionality, a broker declares support for each service by including `plan_updateable: true` in its [catalog endpoint](#catalog-mgmt). If this optional field is not included, Cloud Foundry will return a meaningful error to users for any plan change request, and will not make an API call to the broker. If this field is included and configured as true, Cloud Foundry will make API calls to the broker for all plan change requests, and it is up to the broker to validate whether a particular permutation of plan change is supported. Not all permutations of plan changes are expected to be supported. For example, a service may support upgrading from plan "shared small" to "shared large" but not to plan "dedicated". If a particular plan change is not supported, the broker should return a meaningful error message in response.

Responses with any other status code will be interpreted as a failure. Brokers can include a user-facing message in the `description` field; for details see [Broker Errors](#broker-errors).

##### Body #####

All response bodies must be a valid JSON Object (`{}`). This is for future compatibility; it will be easier to add fields in the future if JSON is expected rather than to support the cases when a JSON body may or may not be returned.

For a success response, the expected response body is `{}`.

## <a id='binding'></a>Binding ##

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Not all services must be bindable --- some derive their value just from being provisioned. Brokers that do not provide any bindable services do not need to implement the endpoint for bind requests.</p>

When the broker receives a bind request from the Cloud Controller, it should return information which helps an application to utilize the provisioned resource. This information is generically referred to as `credentials`. Applications should be issued unique credentials whenever possible, so one application's access can be revoked without affecting other bound applications. For more information on credentials, see [Binding Credentials](binding-credentials.html).

In addition, the bind operation can enable streaming of application logs from Cloud Foundry to a consuming service instance. For details, see [Application Log Streaming](app-log-streaming.html).

### Request ###

`PUT /v2/service_instances/:instance_id/service_bindings/:binding_id`

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>:binding_id</code> of a service binding is provided by the Cloud Controller.
<code>:instance_id</code> is the ID of a previously-provisioned service instance; <code>:binding_id</code>
will be used for future unbind requests, so the broker must use it to correlate
the resource it creates.</p>

In this case, `instance_id` refers to the id of an existing service instance in a previous provisioning, while `id` is service binding id generated by Cloud Controller.

### Response ###

<table border="1" class="nice">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Status Code</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>201 Created</td>
  <td>Binding has been created. The expected response body is below.</td>

<tr>
  <td>200 OK</td>
  <td>
    May be returned if the binding already exists and the requested parameters are identical to the existing binding.
    The expected response body is below.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>409 Conflict</td>
  <td>Should be returned if the requested binding already exists. The expected response body is <code>{}</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Responses with any other status code will be interpreted as a failure and an unbind request will be sent to the broker to prevent an orphan being created on the broker. Brokers can include a user-facing message in the `description` field; for details see [Broker Errors](#broker-errors).

##### Body #####

All response bodies must be a valid JSON Object (`{}`). This is for future compatibility; it will be easier to add fields in the future if JSON is expected rather than to support the cases when a JSON body may or may not be returned.

For success responses, the following fields are valid.

<table border="1" class="nice">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Response Field</th>
  <th>Type</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>credentials</td>
  <td>object</td>
  <td>A free-form hash of credentials that the bound application can use to access the service. For more information, see <a href="binding-credentials.html">Binding Credentials</a>.</td>

  <td>syslog_drain_url</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>A URL to which Cloud Foundry should drain logs to for the bound application. For details, see <a href="app-log-streaming.html">Application Log Streaming</a>.</td>

## <a id='unbinding'></a>Unbinding ##

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Brokers that do not provide any bindable services do not need to implement the endpoint for unbind requests.</p>

When a broker receives an unbind request from Cloud Controller, it should
delete any resources it created in bind.
Usually this means that an application immediately cannot access the resource.

### Request ###

##### Route #####
`DELETE /v2/service_instances/:instance_id/service_bindings/:binding_id`

The `:binding_id` in the URL is the identifier of a previously created binding (the same `:binding_id` passed in the bind request). The request has no body, because DELETE requests generally do not have bodies.

##### Parameters #####

The request provides these query string parameters as useful hints for brokers.

<table border="1" class="nice">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Query-String Field</th>
  <th>Type</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>service_id*</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>ID of the service from the catalog. While not strictly necessary, some brokers might make use of this ID.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>plan_id*</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>ID of the plan from the catalog. While not strictly necessary, some brokers might make use of this ID.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

##### cURL #####
<pre class="terminal">
$ curl 'http://username:password@broker-url/v2/service_instances/:instance_id/
  service_bindings/:binding_id?service_id=service-id-here&plan_id=plan-id-here' -X DELETE
</pre>

### Response ###

<table border="1" class="nice">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Status Code</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>200 OK</td>
  <td>Binding was deleted. The expected response body is <code>{}</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>410 Gone</td>
  <td>Should be returned if the binding does not exist. The expected response body is <code>{}</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Responses with any other status code will be interpreted as a failure and the binding will remain in the Cloud Controller database. Brokers can include a user-facing message in the `description` field; for details see [Broker Errors](#broker-errors).

##### Body #####

All response bodies must be a valid JSON Object (`{}`). This is for future compatibility; it will be easier to add fields in the future if JSON is expected rather than to support the cases when a JSON body may or may not be returned.

For a success response, the expected response body is `{}`.

## <a id='deprovisioning'></a>Deprovisioning ##

When a broker receives a deprovision request from Cloud Controller, it should
delete any resources it created during the provision.
Usually this means that all resources are immediately reclaimed for future
provisions.

### Request ###

##### Route #####
`DELETE /v2/service_instances/:instance_id`

The `:instance_id` in the URL is the identifier of a previously provisioned instance (the same
`:instance_id` passed in the provision request).  The request has no body, because DELETE
requests generally do not have bodies.

##### Parameters #####

The request provides these query string parameters as useful hints for brokers.

<table border="1" class="nice">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Query-String Field</th>
  <th>Type</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tr>
  <td>service_id*</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>ID of the service from the catalog. While not strictly necessary, some brokers might make use of this ID. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>plan_id*</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>ID of the plan from the catalog. While not strictly necessary, some brokers might make use of this ID.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

##### cURL #####
<pre class="terminal">
$ curl 'http://username:password@broker-url/v2/service_instances/:instance_id?service_id=
    service-id-here&plan_id=plan-id-here' -X DELETE
</pre>

### Response ###

<table border="1" class="nice">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Status Code</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>200 OK</td>
  <td>Service instance was deleted. The expected response body is <code>{}</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>410 Gone</td>
  <td>Should be returned if the service instance does not exist. The expected response body is <code>{}</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Responses with any other status code will be interpreted as a failure and the service instance will remain in the Cloud Controller database. Brokers can include a user-facing message in the `description` field; for details see [Broker Errors](#broker-errors).

##### Body #####

All response bodies must be a valid JSON Object (`{}`). This is for future compatibility; it will be easier to add fields in the future if JSON is expected rather than to support the cases when a JSON body may or may not be returned.

For a success response, the expected response body is `{}`.

## <a id='broker-errors'></a>Broker Errors ##

### Response ###

Broker failures beyond the scope of the well-defined HTTP response codes listed
above (like 410 on delete) should return an appropriate HTTP response code
(chosen to accurately reflect the nature of the failure) and a body containing a valid JSON Object (not an array).

##### Body #####

All response bodies must be a valid JSON Object (`{}`). This is for future compatibility; it will be easier to add fields in the future if JSON is expected rather than to support the cases when a JSON body may or may not be returned.

For error responses, the following fields are valid. If empty JSON is returned in the body `{}`, a generic message containing the HTTP response code returned by the broker will be displayed to the requestor.

<table border="1" class="nice">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Response Field</th>
  <th>Type</th>
  <th>Description</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>description</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>An error message explaining why the request failed. This message will be displayed to the user who initiated the request.

## <a id='orphans'></a>Orphans ##

The Cloud Controller is the source of truth for service instances and bindings. Service brokers are expected to have successfully provisioned all the instances and bindings Cloud Controller knows about, and none that it doesn't.

Orphans can result if the broker does not return a response before a request from Cloud Controller times out (typically 60 seconds). For example, if a broker does not return a response to a provision request before Cloud Controller times out, the broker might eventually succeed in provisioning an instance after Cloud Controller considers the request a failure. This results in an orphan instance on the service side.

To mitigate orphan instances and bindings, Cloud Controller will attempt to delete resources it cannot be sure were successfully created, and will keep trying to delete them until the broker responds with a success.

More specifically, when a provision or bind request to the broker times out or the broker returns a 5xx response, Cloud Controller will immediately send a corresponding delete or unbind request. If the delete or unbind request fails (request times out, or the broker returns a 5xx), Cloud Controller will retry the request at increasing intervals until the broker responds with a success (maximum ten tries), doubling the time interval with each failed request.

If the Cloud Controller encounters an internal error provisioning an instance or binding (for example, saving to the database fails), then the Cloud Controller will send a single delete or unbind request to the broker but will not retry.

This orphan mitigation behavior was introduced in cf-release v196.
