title: App Log streaming
owner: Core Services

When you bind an application to an instance of an applicable service, Cloud Foundry streams logs for the
bound application to the service instance.

- Logs for all apps bound to a log consuming service instance are streamed to that instance.
- Logs for an app bound to multiple log consuming service instances are streamed to all instances.

To activate this capability, a service broker must implement the following:

1. In the [catalog](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md#catalog-management) endpoint, the broker must include `requires: syslog_drain`. This minor security measure validates that a service returning a `syslog_drain_url` in response to the [bind](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md#binding) operation has also declared that it expects log streaming.
If the broker does not include `requires: syslog_drain`, and the bind request returns a value for `syslog_drain_url`,
Cloud Foundry returns an error for the bind operation.

2. In response to a [bind](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md#binding) request, the broker returns a value for `syslog_drain_url`. The syslog URL has a scheme of syslog, syslog-tls, or https and can include a port number. For example:

    `"syslog_drain_url": "syslog://logs.example.com:1234"`

## How does it work?

1. Service broker returns a value for `syslog_drain_url` in response to bind.
1. Loggregator periodically polls an internal Cloud Controller endpoint for updates.
1. Upon discovering a new `syslog_drain_url`, Loggregator identifies the associated app.
1. Loggregator streams app logs for that app to the locations specified by the service instances' `syslog_drain_url`s.

You can manually configure app logs to be streamed to a location of your choice
using user-provided service instances.
