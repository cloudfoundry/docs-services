This topic provides information about enabling service instance sharing in managed services.

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

Service authors can allow instances of their services to be shared across spaces and orgs within Cloud Foundry.
This enables apps running in different spaces and orgs to use the same service instance.
Developers with Space Developer permissions in the space where the service instance was created are responsible for sharing, unsharing, updating, and deleting the service instance.

For more information about the developer and administrator tasks related to service instance sharing, see [Sharing Service Instances](../devguide/services/sharing-instances.html).

## <a id="enabling"></a> Enabling Service Instance Sharing

Service brokers must explicitly enable service instance sharing by setting a flag in their service-level metadata object.
This allows service instances, of any service plan, to be shared across orgs and spaces.
The `"shareable"` flag must be set to `true` in the service-level metadata to enable service instance sharing. If the flag is set to `false` or is absent, sharing is disabled.

An example catalog is shown below:

```
{
   "services":[{
      "id":"766fa866-a950-4b12-adff-c11fa4cf8fdc",
      "name": "example-service",
      "metadata": {
         "shareable": true
      }
   }]
}
```

## <a id="binding-permissions"></a> Binding Permissions Based on Instance Sharing

When a service instance is created in one space and shared into another, developers can bind their apps to the service instance from both spaces. 

You may want to have the service broker return credentials with different permissions depending on which space an app is bound from. For example, a messaging service may permit writes from the originating space and only reads from any spaces that the service is shared into.

To determine whether the space of the app is the same as the originating space of the service instance, the service broker can compare the `context.space_guid` and `bind_resource.space_guid` fields in the binding request. The `context.space_guid` field represents the space where the service instance was created, and `bind_resource.space_guid` represents the space of the app involved in the binding.

## <a id="security"></a> Security Considerations

Service authors must consider the following before enabling service instance sharing:

* [Service keys](../devguide/services/service-keys.html) can only be generated
by users who have access to the space where the service instance was created.
This ensures that only developers with access to this space have visibility
into where and how many times the service instance is used.

* Consider the impact of giving out excessive permissions for service bindings,
especially bindings that originate from spaces that the service instance has
been shared into. For example, a messaging service may permit writes from the
originating space and only reads from any shared spaces. For more information,
see [Binding Permissions Based on Instance Sharing](#binding-permissions).

* You should generate unique credentials for each binding. This ensures that
developers can unshare a service instance at any time. Unsharing an instance
deletes any service bindings and revokes access for those credentials.
Unsharing an instance prevents unauthorized future access from developers and
apps that saved the credentials they were previously provided using the
service binding.

* Consider the impact of a service instance dashboard being accessed by users of shared service instances. If authenticating through SSO, see [Dashboard Single Sign-On](./dashboard-sso.html).
