The following example service broker applications have been developed in Cloud Foundry. This is a
good starting point
if you are developing your own service broker.

## Ruby

* [GitHub Repository service](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/github-service-broker-ruby) - this is designed to be an easy-to-read example of a service broker, with complete documentation, and comes with a demo app that uses the service. The broker can be deployed as an application to any Cloud Foundry instance or hosted elsewhere. The service broker uses GitHub as the service back end.
* [MySQL database service](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release) - this broker and its accompanying MySQL server are designed to be deployed together as a [BOSH](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh) release. BOSH is used to deploy or upgrade the release, monitors the health of running components, and restarts or recreates unhealthy VMs. The broker code alone can be found [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-broker).

## Java

* [Spring Cloud - Cloud Foundry Service Broker](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-service-broker) - This implements the REST contract for service brokers and the artifacts are published to the Spring Maven repository.  This greatly simplifies development: include a single dependency in Gradle, implement interfaces, and configure. A sample implementation has been provided for [MongoDB](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cloudfoundry-service-broker).
* [MySQL Java Broker](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-mysql-java-broker) - a Java port of the Ruby-based [MySQL broker](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-broker).

## Go

* [Asynchronous Service Broker for AWS EC2](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/go_service_broker) - This broker implements support for [Asynchronous Service Operations](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md#asynchronous-operations), and calls AWS APIs to provision EC2 VMs.
